<h1 align="center">Suspendors Official Demo</h1>

Using Bootstrap-like naming conventions, Suspendors is a lightweight scss alternative for use in smaller projects where the weight of bootstrap would be unwarranted. There are no default styles, bloat or otherwise large unnecessary included elements to bog down the project, only a small simple to use grid system with margin and padding built in, and a unique javascript callback system that perfectly aligns with the grid. 

## Usage Notes

This Is just a demonstration of the capabilities of Suspendors, to install it either:
-  run the command `npm i suspendors`
- download from the original repo [here](https://github.com/Aulero99/suspendors).

and follow the implementation instructions found in the Suspendors repo.
