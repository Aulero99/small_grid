# Small Grid, A Smaller Sass Grid System

Using Bootstrap-like naming conventions, Small_Grid is a lightweight scss alternative for use in smaller projects where the weight of bootstrap would be unwarented. There are no default styles, bloat or otherwise large unnecessary includes to bog down the project, only a small simple to use grid system with margin and padding built in, just like in bootstrap.  

## Using: Vite, Vue, & Sass

NOTE: After forking this file, you need to run npm i to download and install dependencies of vue and vite, see documentation of vue and vite for more information.
